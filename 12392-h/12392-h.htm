    <p>The originality of the plot of <i>The English Rose</i> (the
    new play at the Adelphi) having been questioned, the following
    Scotch Drama is published with a view of ascertaining if it has
    been done before. Those of our readers who think they recognise
    either the situations or any part of the dialogue, will kindly
    remember that treatment is everything, and the imputation of
    plagiarism is the feeblest of all charges. The piece is called
    <i>Telmah</i>, and is written in Three Acts, sufficiently
    concise to be given in full:&mdash;</p>

    <h4>ACT I.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>The Horse Guards Parade, Elsinore, near
        Edinburgh.</i></p>

        <p><i>Enter</i> MACCLAUDIUS, MACGERTRUDE, <i>Brilliant
        Staff, and Scotch Guards. The Colours are trooped.</i></p>

        <p><i>Then enter</i> TELMAH, <i>who returns salute of
        Sentries.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>MacClaudius</i>. I am just glad you have joined us,
    TELMAH.</p>

    <p><i>Telmah</i>. Really! I fancied some function was going on,
    but thought it was a parade, in honour of my father's
    funeral.</p>

    <p><i>MacGertrude</i> (<i>with a forced laugh</i>). Don't be so
    absurd! Your poor father&mdash;the very best of men&mdash;died
    months ago.</p>

    <p><i>Telmah</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). So long!</p>

    <p><i>MacClaudius</i> (<i>aside</i>). Ma gracious! He's in one
    of his nasty tempers, MACGERTRUDE. Come away! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
    Believe me, I shall drink your health to-night in Perrier Jouet
    of '74. Come!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Exeunt with</i> Queen <i>and</i> Guards.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Telmah</i>. Oh! that this too solid flesh would melt!
    (<i>Enter</i> Ghost.) Hallo! Who are you?</p>

    <p><i>Ghost</i> (<i>impressively</i>). I am thy father's
    spirit! List, TELMAH, oh, list!</p>

    <p><i>Telmah</i>. Would, with pleasure, were I not already a
    Major in the Army, and an Hon. Colonel in the Militia.</p>

    <p><i>Ghost</i> (<i>severely</i>). None of your nonsense!
    (<i>More mildly.</i>) Don't be frivolous!
    (<i>Confidentially.</i>) I was murdered by a serpent, who now
    wears my crown.</p>

    <p><i>Telmah</i> (<i>in a tone of surprise</i>). O my prophetic
    soul! Mine uncle?</p>

    <p><i>Ghost</i>. Right you are! Swear to avenge me!</p>

    <p><i>Telmah</i> (<i>after an internal struggle</i>). I
    swear!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Solo for the big drum. Re-enter troops, spectral
        effect, and tableau.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Act II.&mdash;<i>Interior of the Palace of Elsinore, near
    Edinburgh, arranged for Private Theatricals.</i> MACCLAUDIUS,
    MACGERTRUDE <i>and Court seated, with</i> TELMAH <i>acting as
    Prompter.</i></h4>

    <p><i>MacClaudius</i> (<i>aside to</i> MACPOLONIUS). Lord
    Chamberlain, have you heard the argument? Is there no offence
    in't?</p>

    <p><i>MacPolonius</i>. Well, Sire, as I understand it is not
    intended for public representation, I have not done more than
    glance at it. I am told it is very clever, and called "<i>The
    Mouse-trap</i>."</p>

    <p><i>MacGertrude</i>. Rather an idiotic title!
    (<i>Contemptuously.</i>) "<i>The Mouse-trap</i>!"</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Business. A King on the mimic stage goes to sleep,
        and a shrouded figure pours poison into his ear.</i>
        MACCLAUDIUS <i>rises abruptly.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Telmah</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). He poisons him for his
    estate. His name's MACGONZAGO. The story is extant, and writ in
    choice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer gets the
    love of MACGONZAGO's wife!</p>

    <p><i>MacClaudius</i> (<i>angrily to</i> MACPOLONIUS).
    Chamberlain, we part this day month! Ma gracious! [<i>Exit,
    followed by</i> Queen <i>and</i> Court.</p>

    <p><i>Telmah</i> (<i>exultantly</i>). Now could I drink hot
    blood, and do such bitter business as the day would quake to
    look on!</p>

    <p><i>Ghost</i> (<i>entering abruptly</i>). Well, do it! What's
    the good of all this play-acting? Cut the ranting, and come to
    the slaughtering! (<i>Seizes</i> TELMAH <i>by the arm.</i>) If
    you are an avenger, behave as such!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[TELMAH <i>greatly alarmed, sinks on his knees
        before</i> Ghost, <i>and the Curtain falls on the
        tableau.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>ACT III.&mdash;<i>The Military Tournament at the
    Agricultural Hall, Elsinore, near Edinburgh</i>, TELMAH,
    <i>and</i> MACLAERTES, <i>discovered fencing.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Captain MacOsric, R.A.</i> (<i>Superintendent of the
    Circus</i>). A hit, a palpable hit! (TELMAH <i>and</i>
    MACLAERTES <i>engage a second time, and</i> MACLAERTES
    <i>wounds his opponent.</i>) One to white! (<i>Points out</i>
    MACLAERTES <i>with a small flag. Another round, when</i> TELMAH
    <i>wounds</i> MACLAERTES.) One to black!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Touches</i> TELMAH <i>with his flag.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>MacClaudius</i> (<i>pouring out a glass of cheap
    champagne</i>). Here, TELMAH, you are heated, have a drink!</p>

    <p><i>Telmah</i>. I'll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.
    (<i>Aside to</i> MAC-HORATIO, <i>who smiles.</i>) I know his
    cellar!</p>

    <p><i>MacGertrude</i>. I will take it for you, dear!
    (<i>Impatiently.</i>) Give me the cup? (<i>Seizes it.</i>) The
    Queen carouses to thy fortunes, TELMAH! [<i>Drinks eagerly and
    with gusto.</i></p>

    <p><i>MacClaudius</i> (<i>aside</i>). The poisoned cup at
    eighteen shillings the dozen! It is too late! Ma gracious!
    [QUEEN <i>dies in agonies.</i></p>

    <p><i>MacLaertes</i>. TELMAH, I am slain, and so are
    you&mdash;the foils are tipped with poison! (<i>Speaking with
    difficulty.</i>) Prod the old 'un!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Dies.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Telmah.</i> The point envenomed, too! Then venom do thy
    work!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Stabs King and dies.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Ghost</i> (<i>entering in blue fire, triumphantly to</i>
    MACCLAUDIUS). Now, you'll remember me! [MACCLAUDIUS
    <i>dies.</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Soft music. Scene sinks, discovering magnificent
        funeral ceremony at the Abbey, Elsinore, near Edinburgh. A
        solemn dirge (specially composed for this new and original
        piece) is sung. Slow Curtain.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>PROS AND CONS OF FOREIGN TRAVEL.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By a Hesitating Trippist.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Antwerp</i>.&mdash;Lots of Rubens, <i>but</i> the Harwich
    route is objectionable in "dusty" weather.</p>

    <p><i>Boulogne</i>.&mdash;Great attraction this
    year&mdash;Ex-Queen of NAPLES installed&mdash;<i>but</i> the
    port, at low tide, requires all the perfumes of Araby, and
    more.</p>

             alt="Mr. Punch, floating and smoking." /></a>
    </div>

    <p><i>Cologne</i>.&mdash;Cathedral finished, <i>but</i> local
    scent is accurately expressed by "Oh!"</p>

    <p><i>Dieppe</i>.&mdash;Casino cheery, <i>but</i> the passage
    from Newhaven to French coast at times too terrible for
    words.</p>

    <p><i>Etretat</i>.&mdash;Amusing society, <i>but</i> the
    sanitary arrangements are rather shady.</p>

    <p><i>Florence</i>.&mdash;The Capital of Art, <i>but</i> at its
    worst in the dog days.</p>

    <p><i>Geneva</i>.&mdash;Within reach of Mont Blanc, <i>but</i>
    hotels indifferent, even when under "Royal Patronage."</p>

    <p><i>Heidelberg</i>.&mdash;Magnificent view from the Castle,
    <i>but</i> too many Cooks spoil the prospect.</p>

    <p><i>Interlaken</i>.&mdash;Jungfrau splendid, <i>but</i> not
    free from 'ARRIES and 'ARRIETTS.</p>

    <p><i>Jerusalem</i>.&mdash;Interesting associations, <i>but</i>
    travelling on mule-back is a trial to born pedestrians.</p>

    <p><i>Kissingen</i>.&mdash;Out of the beaten track, <i>but</i>
    query rather too much so.</p>

    <p><i>Lucerne</i>.&mdash;Lovely; <i>but</i> comfort takes a
    back seat if the Schweitzerhoff is full.</p>

    <p><i>Madrid</i>.&mdash;Plenty of pictures, <i>but</i> cholera
    in the neighbourhood.</p>

    <p><i>Naples</i>.&mdash;Famous Bay never off, <i>but</i>
    scarcely the place to face an epidemic.</p>

    <p><i>Ouchy</i>.&mdash;Beau Rivage beyond all praise,
    <i>but</i> environs uninteresting.</p>

    <p><i>Paris</i>.&mdash;Always pleasant&mdash;<i>save</i> in
    August.</p>

    <p><i>Quebec</i>.&mdash;Possibly attractive to the wildly
    adventurous, <i>but</i> scarcely worthy of a jaunt across the
    Atlantic.</p>

    <p><i>Rome</i>.&mdash;The City of the Popes and the
    C&aelig;sars, <i>but</i> not to be thought of before the early
    winter.</p>

    <p><i>St. Malo</i>.&mdash;Quaint old Breton port, <i>but</i>
    journey from Southampton frequently dangerous, and always
    disagreeable.</p>

    <p><i>Turin</i>.&mdash;Typical Italian town; <i>but</i> why go
    here when other places are equally accessible?</p>

    <p><i>Utrecht</i>.&mdash;Suggestive of cheap velvet, <i>but</i>
    suggestive of nothing else.</p>

    <p><i>Vevey</i>.&mdash;Pleasantly situated, <i>but triste</i>
    to the last degree.</p>

    <p><i>Wiesbaden</i>.&mdash;Kept its popularity, in spite of its
    loss of <i>roulette</i> and <i>trente et quarante</i>;
    <i>but</i> Baden-Baden is preferable.</p>

    <p><i>X les Bains</i>.&mdash;Beautiful scenery, <i>but</i>
    population chiefly invalids.</p>

    <p><i>Zurich</i>.&mdash;Might do worse than go there;
    <i>but</i>, on the other hand, why not stay at home?</p>

        <p><i>Polly</i> (<i>about 22; a tall brunette, of the
        respectable lower middle-class, with a flow of light
        badinage, and a taste for tormenting.</i>)</p>

        <p><i>Flo</i> (<i>18; her friend; shorter, somewhat less
        pronounced in manner; rather pretty, simply and tastefully
        dressed; milliner or bonnet-maker's apprentice.</i>)</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Ernest Hawkins</i> (<i>otherwise known as</i>
        "ERNIE 'ORKINS"; 19 <i>or</i> 20; <i>short, sallow,
        spectacled; draper's assistant; a respectable and
        industrious young fellow, who chooses to pass in his hours
        of ease as a blas&eacute; misogynist</i>).</p>

        <p><i>Alfred</i> (<i>his friend; shorter and sallower; a
        person with a talent for silence, which he cultivates
        assiduously</i>).</p>

        <p>POLLY <i>and</i> FLO <i>are seated upon chairs by the
        path, watching the crowd promenading around the enclosure
        where the Band is playing.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Polly</i> (<i>to</i> FLO). There's ERNIE
    'ORKINS;&mdash;he doesn't see us yet. 'Ullo, ERNIE, come 'ere
    and talk to us, won't you?</p>

    <p><i>Flo</i>. Don't, POLLY. I'm sure <i>I</i> don't want to
    talk to him!</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. Now you know you <i>do</i>, FLO,&mdash;more
    than I do, if the truth was known. It's all on your account I
    called out to him.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Hawkins</i> (<i>coming up</i>). 'Ullo! so
    <i>you</i>'re 'ere, are you?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Stands in front of their chairs in an easy attitude.
        His friend looks on with an admiring grin in the
        background, unintroduced, but quite happy and
        contented.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. Ah, <i>we</i>'re 'ere all right enough. 'Ow
    did <i>you</i> get out?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>his dignity slightly ruffled</i>). 'Ow did
    I get out? I'm not in the 'abit of working Sundays if <i>I</i>
    know it.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. Oh, I thought p'raps <i>she</i> wouldn't let
    you come out without 'er. (Mr. H. <i>disdains to notice this
    insinuation.</i>) Why, how you are blushing up, FLO! She looks
    quite nice when she blushes, don't she?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>who is of the same opinion, but considers
    it beneath him to betray his sentiments</i>). Can't say, I'm
    sure; I ain't a judge of blushing myself. I've forgotten how
    it's done.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. Ah! I dessay you found it convenient to
    forget. (<i>A pause.</i> Mr. H. <i>smiles in well-pleased
    acknowledgment of this tribute to his brazen demeanour.</i>)
    Did ARTHUR send you a telegraph?&mdash;he sent FLO one.
    [<i>This is added with a significance intended to excite</i>
    Mr. H.'s <i>jealousy.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>unperturbed</i>). No; he telegraphed to
    father, though. He's gettin' on well over at Melbun, ain't he?
    They think a lot of him out there. And now gettin' his name in
    the paper, too, like that, why&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Flo</i>. That'll do him a lot of good, 'aving his name in
    the paper, won't it?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> Oh, ARTHUR's gettin' on fine. Have you read
    the letters he's sent over? No? Well, you come in to-morrow
    evening and have a look at 'em. Look sharp, or they'll be lent
    out again; they've been the reg'lar round, I can tell you. I
    shall write and blow 'im up, though, for not sending me a
    telegraft, too.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. You! 'Oo are <i>you</i>? You're on'y his
    brother, you are. It's different, his sending one to FLO.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>not altogether relishing this last
    suggestion</i>). Ah, well, I dessay I shall go out there
    myself, some day.</p>

    <blockquote>

        that.</i></p>

    <p><i>Flo</i>. Yes, you'd better. It would make you quite a
    man, wouldn't it? [<i>Both girls titter.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>nettled</i>). 'Ere, I say, I'm off.
    Good-bye! Come on, ALF!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> What 'er? I don't know any 'er.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i> (<i>archly</i>). Oh, you think we 'aven't
    'eard. 'Er where you live now. <i>We</i> know all about it!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> Then you know more than what <i>I</i> do.
    There's nothing between me and anybody where <i>I</i> live. But
    I'm going out to Ostralia, though. I've saved up 'alf of what I
    want already.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i> (<i>banteringly</i>). You <i>are</i> a good
    boy. Save up enough for <i>me</i> too!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>surveying her with frank
    disparagement</i>). <i>You</i>? Oh, lor! Not if I know it!</p>

    <p><i>Flo</i> (<i>with an exaggerated sigh</i>). Oh dear, I
    wish I was over there. They say they're advertising for
    maidservants&mdash;fifteen shillings a week, and the washing
    put out. I'd marry a prince or a lord duke, perhaps, when I got
    there. ARTHUR sent me a fashion-book.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> So he sent me one, too. It was the Autumn
    fashions. They get their Autumn in the Spring out there, you
    know, and their Christmas Day comes in the middle of July.
    Seems rum, doesn't it?</p>

    <p><i>Flo</i>. He sent me his photo, too. He <i>has</i>
    improved.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. You go out there, ERNIE, and p'raps
    <i>you</i>'ll improve. [FLO <i>giggles.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>hurt</i>). There, that's
    enough&mdash;good-bye.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i> (<i>persuasively</i>). 'Ere, stop! I want to
    speak to you. Is your girl here?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>glad of this opportunity</i>). My girl? I
    ain't got no girl. I don't believe in 'em&mdash;a lot
    of&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). A lot of what? Go
    on&mdash;don't mind <i>us</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> It don't matter. <i>I</i> know what they
    are.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. But you like Miss PINKNEY, though,&mdash;at
    the shop in Queen's Road,&mdash;<i>you</i> know.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>by way of proclaiming his
    indifference</i>). Miss PINKNEY? She ought to be Mrs. SOMEBODY
    by this time,&mdash;she's getting on for thirty.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. Ah, but she don't look it, does she: not with
    that lovely coloured 'air and complexion? You knew she painted,
    I dessay? She don't look&mdash;well, not more than thirty-two,
    at the outside. She spends a lot on her 'air, I know. She sent
    our GEORGY one day to the 'air-dresser's for a bottle of the
    stuff she puts on, and the barber sez: "What, do <i>you</i> dye
    your 'air?" To little <i>GEORGY</i>! fancy!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> Well, she may dye herself magenter for all I
    care. (<i>Changing the subject.</i>) ARTHUR's found a lot of
    old friends at Melbun,&mdash;first person he come upon was a
    policeman as used to be at King Street; and you remember that
    Miss LAVENDER he used to go out with? (<i>Speaking at</i> FLO.)
    Well, her brother was on board the steamer he went in.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. It's all right, FLO, ain't it? so long as it
    wasn't Miss LAVENDER herself! (<i>To</i> Mr. H.) I say, ain't
    you got a moustarsh comin'!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>wounded for the third time</i>). That'll
    do. I'm off this time! [<i>The devoted</i> ALF <i>once more
    prepares for departure.</i></p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. All right! Tell us where you'll be, and we may
    come and meet you. I daresay we shall find you by the Outer
    Circle,&mdash;where the children go when they get lost. I say,
    ERNIE, look what a short frock that girl's got on.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>lingering undecidedly</i>). I don't want
    to look at no girls, I tell
    you.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. What, can't you see <i>one</i> you
    like,&mdash;not out of all this lot?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> Not one. Plenty of 'ARRIETS!
    [<i>Scornfully.</i></p>

    <p><i>Flo.</i> Ah! and 'ARRIES too. There's a girl looking at
    you, ERNIE; do turn round.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>loftily</i>). I'm sure I shan't look at
    <i>her</i>, then. I expected a cousin of mine would ha' turned
    up here by now.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. I wish he'd come. P'raps I might fall in love
    with him,&mdash;who knows?&mdash;or else FLO might.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> Ah! he's a reg'lar devil, I can tell you, my
    cousin is. Why, I'm a saint to <i>'im!</i></p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. Oh, I daresay! "Self-praise," you know!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>with a feeling that he is doing himself an
    injustice</i>). Not but what I taught him one or two things he
    didn't know, when he was with me at Wandsworth. (<i>Thinks he
    won't go until he has dropped one more hint about
    Australia.</i>) As to Ostralia, you know, I've quite made up my
    mind to go out there as soon as I can. I ain't <i>said</i>
    nothing, but I've been meaning it all along. They won't mind my
    going at home, like they did ARTHUR's, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Flo</i> (<i>in a tone of cordial assent</i>). Oh no, of
    <i>course</i> not. It isn't as if you were 'im, <i>is</i>
    it?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. H.</i> (<i>disappointed, but still bent on asserting
    his own value</i>). You see, I'm independent. I can always find
    a berth, <i>I</i> can. I don't believe in keeping on anywhere
    longer than I'm comfortable. Not but what I shall stick to
    where I am a bit longer, because I've a chance of a rise soon.
    The Guv'nor don't like the man in the Manchester department, so
    I expect I shall get his berth. I get on well with the Guv'nor,
    you know, and he treats us very fair;&mdash;we've a
    setting-room to ourselves, and we can come and set in the
    droring-room of a Sunday afternoon, like the family; and I
    often have to go into the City, and, when I get up there, I can
    tell yer, I&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Flo</i> (<i>suddenly</i>). Oh! there's Mother! I must go
    and speak to her a minute. Come, POLLY!</p>

    <h2>A VERY SHORT HOLIDAY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By One who enjoyed it.</i>)</h4>

    <p>It having occurred to me that within a few days I might get
    an entire change by visiting some thoroughly French seaside
    places on the coast of Normandy, I started <i>vi&acirc;</i>
    Southampton for Havre.</p>

    <p>I started mysteriously at midnight. Lights down. We glided
    out, almost sneaked out, as if ashamed of ourselves. I had
    pictured to myself sitting out on deck, enjoying the lovely air
    and the picturesque view. <i>L'homme propose, la mer
    dispose.</i> I retired early, and enjoyed neither the lovely
    air nor the picturesque view. "The rest is&mdash;silence," or
    as much silence as possible, and as much rest as possible.</p>

             alt="Dining al fresco." /></a>The "Screen Scene," as
             played on a gusty night on the covered terrace at
             Frascati's, Le Havre.
    </div>

    <p>8'30 A.M.&mdash;Le Havre. Consul's chief
    attendant,&mdash;<i>Lictor</i>, I suppose, the master being a
    consul,&mdash;sees me and my baggage through the
    customs&mdash;"customs more honoured in the breach than the
    observance,"&mdash;and in five minutes I am&mdash;that is,
    <i>we</i> are, the pair of us&mdash;at the H&ocirc;tel
    Frascati, which, whether it be the best or not I cannot say, is
    certainly the liveliest, and the only one with a covered
    terrace facing the sea where you can breakfast, dine, and
    generally enjoy a life which, for the time being, is worth
    living. <i>&Agrave; propos</i> of this terrace, I merely give
    the proprietor of Frascati a hint,&mdash;the one drawback to
    the comfort of dining or breakfasting in this upper terrace is
    the door which communicates with the lower terrace, and through
    which everyone is constantly passing. We know that <i>Il faut
    qu'une porte soit ouverte ou ferm&eacute;e</i>. But this is
    opened and shut, or not shut, and, if shut, more or less
    banged, every three minutes. If it isn't banged, it bursts open
    of its own accord, and whacks the nearest person violently on
    the back, or hits a table, and scatters the bottles, or, if not
    misbehaving itself in this way (which is only when rude Boreas
    is at his rudest), it admits such a draught as causes
    bald-headed men to rage, ladies to shiver, delicate persons to
    sneeze, and, finally, impels the diners to raise such a
    clattering of knife-handles on the different tables, as if they
    were applauding a speech or a comic song. Then the
    <i>ma&icirc;tre-d'h&ocirc;tel</i> rushes at the door and closes
    it violently,&mdash;only for it to be re-opened a minute
    afterwards by a waiter or visitor entering from the terrace
    below! A mechanical contrivance and a light screen would do
    away with the nuisance, for a nuisance it most undoubtedly is.
    The perpetual banging causes headache, irritation, and
    indigestion, and those who have suffered <i>n'y reviendront
    pas</i>, like several <i>Marlbrooks</i>. Let the proprietor
    look to this, and, where most things are done so well, and not
    unreasonably, don't let there be a Havre-and-Havre policy of
    hotel management. <i>Allons!</i></p>

    <p>I am writing this paper for the sake of those who have only
    a very few days for a holiday, and like to make the most of it
    in the way of thorough change. If you select Havre as your
    head-quarters for Trouville, Cabourg, and Dives, <i>you must be
    a good sailor</i>, as you can only reach these places by sea;
    and three-quarters of an hour bad passage there, with the
    prospect of three-quarters of an hour worse passage back at
    some inconvenient hour of the evening, destroys all chance of
    enjoyment. If you're not a good sailor, remain on the Havre
    side of the Seine, and there's plenty to be seen there to
    occupy you from Saturday afternoon till Wednesday evening, when
    <i>The Wolf</i> (what a name!) makes its return voyage to
    Southampton.</p>

    <p>If the sea at Dives, in 1066 A.D., had been anything like
    what it was at Havre the other day, when I wanted to cross over
    to Dives, WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR would never have sailed from
    that place for the invasion of England. Dull as he might have
    found Dives, yet I am sure the Conquering Hero would have
    preferred returning to Paris, to risking the discomfort of the
    crossing. By the way, the appropriate station in Paris for
    Dives would be Saint-Lazaire.</p>

    <p>Then there are Honfleur, and Harfleur, and most people know
    Ste. Adresse and Etretat. The views and the drives are not
    equal to those about Ilfracombe and Lynton, and Etretat itself
    is only a rather inferior kind of Lynmouth. Those who want
    bracing won't select either Ste. Adresse or Etretat or Havre
    for a prolonged stay. Taking for granted the
    short-holiday-maker will visit all these places, let me give
    him a hint for one day's enjoyment, for which, I fancy, I shall
    earn his eternal gratitude. Order a carriage with two horses at
    Havre, start at nine or 9'30, and drive to Etretat by way of
    Marviliers. Stop at the H&ocirc;tel de Vieux Plats at
    Gonneville for breakfast. Never will you have seen a house so
    full of curiosities of all sorts; the walls are covered with
    clever sketches and paintings by more or less well-known
    artists, and the service of the house is carried on by M. and
    Mme. AUBOURG, their son and daughter, who, with the assistance
    of a few neat-handed Phyllises, do everything themselves for
    their customers, and are at once the best of cooks,
    <i>somm&eacute;liers</i>, and waiters. So cheery, so full of
    life and fun, so quick, so attentive, serving you as if you
    were the only visitor in the place, though the little inn is as
    full as it can be crammed, and there are fifty persons
    breakfasting there at the same moment.</p>

    <p>Every room being occupied, and every nook in the garden too,
    we are accommodated with a rustic table in the "Grand Salon,"
    part of which is screened off as a kind of bar. The "Grand
    Salon" is also full of quaint pictures and eccentric
    curiosities; it is cool and airy, bright flowers are in the
    windows, and the floor is sanded. We had stopped here to
    refresh the horses, intending to breakfast at Etretat. But so
    delighted were we, a party of "<i>deux couverts</i>," with this
    good hotel, and still more with the <i>famille Aubourg</i>,
    that, though we had driven away, and were a mile further on our
    road to Etretat, we decided&mdash;and Counsellor Hunger was our
    adviser too&mdash;on returning to this house where we had
    noticed breakfast-table tastefully laid out for some expected
    visitors, and had been in the kitchen, and with our own eyes
    had seen, and with our own noses had smelt the appetising
    preparation for the parties already in possession. So we drove
    back again rapidly, much to the delight of our coachman, who
    had become very melancholy, and was evidently forming a very
    poor opinion of persons who could lose the chance of a
    breakfast <i>chez Aubourg</i>.</p>

    </div>

    <p>How pleased Mlle. AUBOURG, the waitress, appeared to be when
    we returned! All the family prepared to kill the fatted calf
    figuratively, as it took the shape of the sweetest and freshest
    shrimps as <i>hors d'oeuvre</i>, and then it became an omelette
    <i>au lard</i> ("O La!") absolutely unsurpassable, and a
    <i>poulet saut&eacute;</i>, which was about the best that ever
    we tasted. A good bottle of the ordinary generous, fruit, and
    then a cup of recently roasted and freshly ground coffee with a
    thimbleful of some special Normandy cognac,&mdash;in which our
    cheery host joined us, and we all drank one another's
    healths,&mdash;completed as good a <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> as
    any man or woman of simple tastes could possibly desire.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Then the cheery son of the house, dressed in a cook's cap
    and apron, pauses in his work to join in our conversation. He
    tells us how he has been in London, and can speak English, and
    is enthusiastic about the satiric journal which <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> publishes weekly. M. AUBOURG <i>fils</i> who is a
    truthful likeness, on a large scale, of M. DAUBRAY, of the
    Palais Royal, informs me that he can play the horn after the
    manner of the guards on the coaches starting from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> "White Horse," Piccadilly;
       and so, when we start for Etretat, he produces a big <i>cor
       de chasse</i>, and, while he sounds the farewell upon it, a
       maid rushes out and rings the parting bell, and M. AUBOURG
       <i>p&eacute;re</i> waves his cap, and Madame her hand, and
       Mlle. her <i>serviette</i>, and we respond with hat and
       handkerchief until we turn the corner, and hear the last
       flourish of the French "horn of the hunter," and see the
       last flourish of pretty Mademoiselle's snow-white
       <i>serviette</i>. Then we go on our way to Etretat,
       rejoicing. But, after this excitement, Etretat palls upon
       us. After a couple of hours of Etretat, we are glad to drive
       up, and up, and up, and get far away and above Etretat,
       where we can breathe again.</p>

    <p>Far better is Fecamp which we tried two days after, and
    Fecamp is just a trifle livelier than Westward Ho! Of course
    its Abbaye is an attraction in itself. It is a place whose
    inhabitants show considerable public spirit, as it is here that
    "Benedictine" is made. When at Le Havre drive over to St.
    Jouin, and breakfast <i>chez Ernestine</i>. Another day you can
    spend at Rouen, returning in the evening to dinner. This is not
    intended as a chapter in a guidebook, but simply as a hint at
    any time to those who need a thorough change in a short time,
    and who do not care to go too far off to get it. When they've
    quite finished building and paving Havre, I'll return there and
    take a few walks. Now the authorities responsible for the
    paving are simply the best friends of the boot-making interest,
    just as in London the Hansoms collectively ought to receive a
    handsome Christmas hat-box from the hatters. But mind this,
    when at Havre drive to Gonneville, and breakfast <i>chez</i> M.
    AUBOURG.</p>

    <h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I have had a communication from Mr. JEREMY, written in the
    execrable English of which this calico-livered scoundrel is a
    consummate master, and informing me that, if I care to join the
    staff of the journal which Mr. J. directs, a princely salary
    shall be at my disposal. Mr. J. inquires what special branch of
    fiction it would suit me to undertake, as he proposes to
    publish a serial novel by an author of undoubted imaginative
    power. Here is my answer to Mr. J. I will do nothing for him.
    His compliments I despise. Flattery has never yet caused me to
    falter. And if he desires to prop the tottering fortunes of his
    chowder-headed rag, let him obtain support from the pasty-faced
    pack of cacklers who surround him. I would stretch no finger to
    help him, no, not if I saw him up to his chin in the
    oleo-margarine of which his brains and those of his
    bottle-nosed, flounder-eared friends seem to be composed. So
    much then for Mr. J. <i>Du reste</i>, as TALLEYRAND once said,
    my important duties to the readers of this journal fully absorb
    my time.</p>

    <p>Last week I offered to the public some interesting details
    of the family history of an exalted German prince, whose
    friendship and good-will it has been my fortune to acquire by
    means of the dazzling accuracy of my forecasts of racing events
    in this country. I may state at once that the Grand Cross of
    the Honigthau Order, "<i>mit Diamanten und Perlen</i>," which
    his Serene Highness was good enough to confer upon me, has come
    to hand, and even now sparkles on a breast as incapable of
    deceit as it is ardent in the pursuit of truth. Let this be an
    incitement to the deserving, and a warning to scoffers who
    presume to doubt me. Many other gratifying testimonies of
    foreign approval have reached me. From the immense heap of them
    stored in my front drawing-room, I select the following
    specimens:&mdash;</p>

    <h4>(I.) <i>Buenos Ayres, Monday.</i></h4>

    <p>Revolution crushed entirely by your aid. At the crisis,
    General Pompanilla read <i>all</i> your published writings
    aloud to insurgent chiefs. Effect was magical. They thought
    your prophecies <i>better than ammunition</i>. Ha, ha! Their
    widows have fled the country. A pension of a million
    <i>pesetas</i> awarded to you. Rumours about my resignation a
    mere blind.</p>

    <p>(<i>Signed</i>) Dr. Celman, <i>President</i>.</p>

    <h4>(II.) <i>Buenos Ayres, Monday.</i></h4>

    <p>The traitor Celman has been vanquished, thanks to you. When
    ammunition failed, we loaded with sporting prophecies. Very
    deadly. Treasury cleared directly. One of your adjectives
    annihilated a brigade of infantry.</p>

    <p>(<i>Here follow the signatures of the Leaders of the Union
    Civica, to the number of</i> 5,000.)</p>

    <h4>(III.) <i>Guatemala, Sunday.</i></h4>

    <p>Victorious army of Guatemala sends thanks to its brave
    champion. Your inspired writings have been set to music, and
    are sung as national hymns. Effect on San Salvadorians
    terrible. Only two deaf sergeants left alive. <i>Guerra,
    Vittoria Matador, Mantilla</i>.</p>

    <p>(<i>Signed</i>) BARILLAS, <i>President</i>.</p>

    <h4>(IV.) <i>San Salvador, Sunday.</i></h4>

    <p>Land pirates from Guatemala foiled, owing to valiant English
    <i>Punch</i>-Prophet. Army when reduced to last biscuit, fed on
    racing intelligence. Captain-General sustained nature on white
    native plant called <i>Tehp</i>, much used by Indian tribe of
    <i>Estar-ting-prisahs</i>. My body-guard performed prodigies on

    <h2>THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Before</i> Mr. Commissioner Punch.)</h4>

    <h4><i>An Engineer Officer, R.N., introduced.</i></h4>

    <p><i>The Commissioner</i>. Sorry to see you here, Sir, as your
    presence argues that you have a right to demand redress.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/89.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/89.png"
             alt="Mr. Commissioner Punch." /></a>
    </div>

    <p><i>Engineer Officer, R.N.</i> I think, Sir, that we have a
    genuine grievance is almost universally conceded. But, as our
    labours and responsibilities have increased enormously of late
    years, perhaps you will kindly allow me to describe our
    duties.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> By all means.</p>

    <p><i>En. Of., R.N.</i> As the matter is of the greatest
    importance to fourteen hundred officers, commanding ten
    thousand men, I hope you will not consider me tedious in making
    the following statement. The success of every function of the
    modern battle-ship depends upon machinery for which the
    Engineer officers are directly responsible. By its means the
    anchor is lifted, boats are hoisted, the ship is steered,
    ventilated, and electrically lighted. Pure drinking water is
    supplied for its hundreds of inhabitants. The efficiency of all
    the elaborate arrangements of the hull for safety in collision,
    fire, or battle, depends upon the Engineers. Their machinery
    trains and elevates, loads and controls the heavy guns. The use
    of the Whitehead torpedo and all its appliances would be an
    impossibility without the Engineers. In addition to this there
    is the propulsion of the ship, and the control and supervision
    of a large staff of artificers and men. And yet the Engineer
    officers are the lowest paid class of commissioned officers in
    the Royal Navy&mdash;this when, without exaggeration, they may
    be described as the hardest-worked.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> It certainly seems unfair that officers of
    your importance should not receive ampler remuneration. When
    was the rate established?</p>

    <p><i>En. Of., R.N.</i> It has seen little change since 1870;
    and you may judge of its justice when I tell you that a young
    Surgeon of twenty-three, appointed to his first ship, receives
    more pay than many Engineer officers who have seen fourteen
    years' service, and have reached the age of thirty-five.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> I am decidedly of opinion that your pay
    should be increased, and I suppose (as evidently there has been
    "class feeling" in the matter) you have had to suffer annoyance
    anent relative rank?</p>

    <p><i>En. Of., R.N.</i> (<i>with a smile</i>). Well, yes, we
    have. But if the Engineer-in-Chief at the Admiralty (who, by
    the way, receives &pound;1000 a-year, and yet is held
    responsible for the design and manufacture of machinery costing
    &pound;12,000,000 per annum) is admitted to be superior to all
    other Engineer officers, we shall be satisfied. Still I cannot
    help saying that the Chief Engineer of a ship is snubbed when
    all is right, and only has his importance and responsibility
    allowed (when indeed it is recognised and paraded) when
    anything is wrong! But let that pass.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> I am afraid it is too late to do anything
    further this Session, as the House is just up. However, if
    matters are not more satisfactory at the end of the recess, let
    me know, and&mdash;but you shall see!</p>

    <p>"A LITTLE MORE THAN GAY BUT LESS THAN GRAVE."&mdash;Not very
    long ago, an act of sacrilege was committed at Canterbury by a
    man, who robbed an alms-box in the Cathedral. However,
    disregarding the precedent set some time since by the Dean and
    Chapter (who it will be remembered dug up and removed the bones
    of the honoured dead) the intruder abstained from touching the
    vaults of those buried in consecrated ground.</p>

    <p>Mon cher "CHAP,"&mdash;Je connais pas votre surnom et c'est
    pourquoi je vous appelle "chap,"&mdash;vous pouvez comprendre,
    je crois, que c'est difficile de commencer un correspondence
    dans une langue qui n'est pas le votre, et surtout avec un chap
    que vous ne connais pas, mais il faut faire un commencement de
    quelque sorte, et malgr&eacute; qu'on m'a dit que vous
    "fellows," &ecirc;tes des <i>duffers</i> (expression Anglaise.
    Un <i>duffer</i> c'est une personne qui n'est pas dans le
    "swim"), qui ne comprenderaient pas un seul mot que je dirai
    sur le sujet, jamais le plus petit, j'essayerai a expliquer
    brefment qu'est-ce que c'est que Le "Cricket."</p>

    <p>Eh bien, le <i>cricket</i> est un "stunning" jeu. "Stunning"
    est une autre expression Anglaise qui veut dire qu'une chose
    est regulairement "a, un," ou de me servir d'argot,
    "parfaitement de premi&egrave;re c&ocirc;telette," et qui
    "prend le g&acirc;teau." Pour faire un cot&eacute; de cricket,
    il faut onze. Je ne suis pas encore dans notre onze, mais
    j'esp&egrave;re d'&ecirc;tre l&agrave; un de ces jours. Mais
    pour continuer. Il y a le "wicket," une chose fait de trois
    morceaux de bois, a qui le "bowler" jette la balle, dur comme
    une pierre, et si &ccedil;a vous attrappe sur le jambe, je vous
    promis, &ccedil;a vous fera sauter. Et bien, avant le wicket se
    place l'homme qui est dedans et qui tient dans ces mains le
    "bat" avec lequel il frappe la balle et fait des courses.
    L'autre jour dans un "allumette" entre deux "counties," un
    professional qui s'appelle <i>Fusil</i> a fait plus que deux
    cents des courses.</p>

    <p>Mais pour continuer encore. Si l'homme qui est dedans ne
    frappe pas la balle, et la balle au contraire frappe les
    "wickets," on tourne a un personage qui s'apelle le "Umpire" et
    lui dit, "Comment &ccedil;a, Monsieur l'Umpire?" et il dit,
    "Dehors!" ou, "Pas dehors!"&mdash;et quand tous les onze sont
    "dehors" le innings est fini, et l'autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;
    commence. Et voil&agrave; le cricket. N'est-ce pas qu'il est,
    comme j'ai dis, un <i>stunning</i> jeu? Eh bien, je crois que,
    pour une premi&egrave;re lettre, j'ai fait le chose en style.
    Ecrivez vous maintenant en r&eacute;ponse, et donnez moi une
    description d'un de votre jeux, pour me montrer que vous
    Fran&ccedil;ais ne sont pas, comme nous pensons en Angleterre,
    tous des "duffers." Le votre sincerement, TOMMY.</p>

    <h2>A NATIONAL APPEAL.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Cannot you do something to help us,
    and save us from a permanent consignment to that wretched
    hole-in-a-corner back street site thrust upon us at the rear of
    the National Gallery? We do not know how far matters may have
    gone, but somebody wrote the other day to <i>The Times</i> to
    protest against the job, and we conclude, therefore, it may not
    yet, perhaps, be too late to agitate for a stay of execution.
    We are not difficult to please, and would be contented with a
    modest but suitable home in any convenient locality. That such
    can be found when really sought for, witness the happy facility
    with which a fitting residence has been discovered in the east
    and west galleries surrounding the Imperial Institute for the
    promised new National Collection. At South Kensington <i>we</i>
    had a narrow escape of a conflagration, from too close a
    proximity to the kitchen of a shilling <i>restaurant</i>. At
    Bethnal Green we have been having a prolonged merry time of it,
    with damp walls behind us and leaking roofs above our heads. At
    one time we were packed away in dusty obscurity, in the
    cupboards of a temporary Government office; and looking back on
    the past, fruitful as it is in recollections of official
    slights and snubs, you may gather that we can have no very
    ambitious designs for the future. We do, however, protest
    against being tacked on as a sort of outside back-stair
    appendage to the National Gallery, that will soon want the
    space we shall be forced to occupy for its own natural and
    legitimate expansion. Suggest a site for us&mdash;anywhere
    else. There is still room on the Embankment. Kensington
    Palace&mdash;is still in the market. Why not be welcome there?
    As representatives for all of us, I subscribe my name
    hereunder, and remain,</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. Toppel</i>. Now that we have the Lord Chancellor, the
    Lord Chief Justice, and the President of the Divorce Division,
    securely locked up together in the attic, <i>and gagged</i>, we
    may, I think, congratulate ourselves on the success of our
    proceedings so far! We are, I am sure, quite agreed as to there
    having been no other course open to us than to imitate our
    Sicilian brethren of the robe, and take to a little mild
    brigandage, considering the awful decay of legal business and
    our own destitute condition. (<i>Sympathetic cries of Hear,
    hear! from the</i> Chancery Barrister, <i>and the two</i>
    Starving Juniors.) I have no doubt that a few hours spent in
    our attic will induce the High Legal Dignitaries I have
    mentioned (<i>laughter</i>) to pay up the modest ransom we
    demand, and to take the additional pledge of secresy.
    Meanwhile, I propose that these sixteen excellent gentlemen
    should re-enter the private Pirate Bus' which is waiting
    down-stairs, and see whether the Master of the Rolls could not
    be&mdash;er&mdash;"detained <i>in transitu</i>" (<i>more
    laughter</i>) while proceeding to his Court. It would be best,
    perhaps, as Lord ESHER belongs to the Equity side, for our
    friend here of the Chancery Bar to accommodate him in
    <i>his</i> Chambers.</p>

    <p><i>Chancery Barrister</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). But I have only
    a basement!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Toppel</i> (<i>calmly</i>). A basement will do very
    well. (<i>To the sixteen Masked Men</i>). You will probably
    find Lord ESHER somewhere about Chancery Lane. Impress on him
    that our fee in his case is a thousand guineas;
    <i>or</i>&mdash;both ears lopped off! [<i>Exeunt the
    Sixteen.</i></p>

    <p><i>First Junior</i>. I went upstairs just now, in order to
    see how our distinguished prisoners were getting on. The
    CHANCELLOR, I regret to say, seemed dissatisfied with the bread
    and water supplied to him, and asked for "necessaries suitable
    to his status." He appeared inclined to argue the point; so I
    had to gag him again.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Toppel</i>. Quite right. You might have told him that
    he is now governed by the <i>lex loci</i>, and that we shall
    reluctantly have to send little pieces of him to his
    friends&mdash;I believe that is the "common form" in brigand
    circles&mdash;if he persists in refusing the ransom. How does
    the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE bear it?</p>

    <p><i>Second Junior</i>. Not well. The attic window is,
    fortunately, barred, but I found him trying to&mdash;in fact,
    to <i>disbar</i> it&mdash;(<i>laughter</i>)&mdash;and to
    attract the attention of a passer-by. He is now secured by a
    chain to a strong staple.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Toppel</i>. I suppose he is not disposed to make the
    assignment to us of half his yearly salary, which we
    suggested?</p>

    <p><i>Second Junior</i>. Not yet. He even threatens, when
    liberated, to bring our conduct under the notice of the
    Benchers.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Toppel</i> (<i>grimly</i>). Then he must never be
    liberated! It's no good beginning this method of what I may
    call, in technical language, 'seisin,' unless we go the whole
    hog. Well, if you two Juniors will attend to
    our&mdash;em&mdash;<i>clients</i>
    upstairs&mdash;(<i>laughter</i>)&mdash;I and our Chancery
    friend will superintend the temporary removal of Lord ESHER
    from the Court that he so much adorns. (<i>Noise heard.</i>)
    Ah, that sounds like Sir JAMES HANNEN banging on the ceiling!
    He must be stopped, as it would be so very awkward if a
    Solicitor were to call. Not that there's much chance of
    <i>that</i> nowadays. (To Chancery Barrister.) Come&mdash;shall
    we try a "set-off"? [<i>Exeunt. Curtain.</i></p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak
            and weary,</p>

            <p>Over many a dry and dusty volume of Blue-Bookish
            lore,&mdash;</p>

            <p>While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a
            yapping,</p>

            <p>As of some toy-terrier snapping, snapping at my
            study door.</p>

            <p>"'Tis some peevish cur," I muttered, "yapping at my
            study door,&mdash;</p>

            <p class="i10">Only that,&mdash;but it's a bore."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Ah! distinctly I remember, it was drawing nigh
            September,</p>

            <p>And each trivial Tory Member pined for stubble,
            copse, and moor;</p>

            <p>Eagerly they wished the morrow; vainly they had
            sought to borrow</p>

            <p>From their SMITH surcease of sorrow, or from GOSCHEN
            or BALFOUR,</p>

            <p>From the lank and languid "miss" the Tory
            <i>claque</i> dubbed "Brave BALFOUR,"</p>

            <p class="i10">Fameless else for evermore.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Party prospects dark, uncertain, sombre as night's
            sable curtain,</p>

            <p>Filled them, thrilled them with fantastic funkings
            seldom felt before;</p>

            <p>So that now, to still the beating of faint hearts,
            they kept repeating</p>

            <p>Futile formulas, entreating Closure for the
            "Obstructive Bore"&mdash;</p>

            <p>With a view to Truth defeating, such they dubbed
            "Obstructive Bore,"</p>

            <p class="i10">As sought Truth, and nothing more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Presently my wrath waxed stronger; hesitating then
            no longer,</p>

            <p>"Cur!" I said; "mad mongrel, truly off your precious
            hide, I'll score;</p>

            <p>Like your cheek to come here yapping, just as I was
            gently napping;</p>

            <p>You deserve a strapping,&mdash;yapping, snapping at
            my study door.</p>

            <p>I shall go for you, mad mongrel!" Here I opened wide
            the door.</p>

            <p class="i10">Darkness there, and nothing more!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there
            nothing hearing,</p>

            <p>Doubting, dreaming dreams of Spooks, Mahatmas,
            Esoteric lore;</p>

            <p>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave
            no token.</p>

            <p>Hist! there <i>were</i> two words soft spoken, those
            stale words, "Obstructive Bore."</p>

            <p>Bosh! I murmured, and some echo whispered back,
            "Obstructive Bore":</p>

            <p class="i10">Merely that, and nothing more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Back into my study turning, with some natural anger
            burning,</p>

            <p>Soon again I heard a sound more like miauling than
            before.</p>

            <p>"Surely," said I, "surely that is a grimalkin at my
            lattice.</p>

            <p>Let me see if it stray cat is, and this mystery
            explore;</p>

            <p>Where's that stick? Ah! wait a moment: <i>I</i>'ll
            this mystery explore;</p>

            <p class="i10">It shall worry me no more!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a
            smirk and flutter,</p>

            <p>In there popped a perky Jackdaw, yapping, miauling
            as before</p>

            <p>(Queer mimetic noises made he), for no introduction
            stayed he,</p>

            <p>But, with plumage sleek, yet shady, perched above my
            study door,&mdash;</p>

            <p>Perched upon a bust of GLADSTONE placed above my
            study door,&mdash;</p>

            <p class="i10">Perched, and croaked "Obstructive
            Bore!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then this mocking bird beguiling my tried temper
            into smiling</p>

            <p>By the lank lopsided languor of the countenance it
            wore.</p>

            <p>"Though you look storm-tost, unshaven, you," I said,
            "have found a haven,</p>

            <p>Daw as roupy as a raven! Was it <i>you</i> yapped at
            my door?</p>

            <p>Tell me your confounded name, O bird in beak so like
            BALFOUR!"</p>

            <p class="i10">Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Much I wondered this ungainly fowl to hear speak up
            so plainly,</p>

            <p>Though his answer little meaning, little relevancy
            bore;</p>

            <p>For we cannot help agreeing that no sober human
            being</p>

            <p>Ever yet was blessed by seeing bird above his study
            door&mdash;</p>

            <p>Bird or beast upon the Grand Old bust above his
            study door,</p>

            <p class="i10">With the name, "Obstructive Bore."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>But the Jackdaw, sitting lonely on that placid bust,
            spake only</p>

            <p>That one word, as though in that his policy he did
            outpour.</p>

            <p>Not another sound he uttered, but his feathers
            proudly fluttered.</p>

            <p>"Ah!" I mused, "the words he muttered other dolts
            have mouthed before.</p>

            <p>Who is he who thinks to scare me with stale cant oft
            mouthed before?"</p>

            <p class="i10">Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Startled at the silence broken by reply so patly
            spoken,</p>

            <p>Doubtless, mused I, what it utters is its only
            verbal store,</p>

            <p>Learnt from some unlucky master, whom well-merited
            disaster</p>

            <p>Followed fast and followed faster, till his speech
            one burden bore&mdash;</p>

            <p>Till his dirges of despair one melancholy burden
            bore,</p>

            <p class="i10">Parrot-like, "Obstructive Bore!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>But the Jackdaw still beguiling my soothed fancy
            into smiling.</p>

            <p>Straight I wheeled my easy-chair in front of bird,
            and bust, and door;</p>

            <p>Then, upon the cushion sinking, I betook myself to
            linking</p>

            <p>Memory unto memory, thinking what this slave of
            parrot-lore&mdash;</p>

            <p>What this lank, ungainly, yet complacent thrall of
            parrot-lore</p>

            <p class="i10">Meant by its "Obstructive Bore."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>This I sat engaged in guessing, strange similitude
            confessing,</p>

            <p>'Twixt this fowl, whose goggle-eyes glared on me
            from above my door,</p>

            <p>And a chap with long legs twining, whom I'd often
            seen reclining</p>

            <p>On the Treasury Bench's lining, Irish anguish
            gloating o'er;</p>

            <p>This same chap with long legs twining Irish anguish
            chuckling o'er,</p>

            <p class="i10">Tories christened, "Brave BALFOUR."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then methought the air grew denser. I remembered
            stout Earl SPENCER,</p>

            <p>And the silly pseudo-Seraph who "obstructed" him of
            yore;</p>

            <p>I remembered Maamtrasma, faction, partisan
            miasma,</p>

            <p>CHURCHILL&mdash;CHURCHILL and his henchman, lank and
            languorous BALFOUR.</p>

            <p>"What," I cried, "was ARTHUR, then, or RANDOLPH, in
            those days of yore?"</p>

            <p class="i10">Quoth the bird, "Obstructive Bore."</p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Prophet!" said I, "of things evil, prophet callous,

            <p>By your favourite '<i>Tu quoque</i>' how can
            <i>you</i> expect to score?</p>

            <p>Though your cheek may be undaunted, little memory is
            wanted,</p>

            <p>And your conscience <i>must</i> be haunted by bad

            Tell me frankly, I implore!"</p>

            door,</p>

            <p>And his eyes have all the seeming of a small

    <h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

    <p>SUBMARINE ENTERPRISE.&mdash;It is a pity, perhaps, that on
    the very first occasion which enabled you to submit, for an
    experimental trial, to the Dockyard Authorities at Portsmouth,
    your newly-designed <i>Self-sinking and Propelling Submarine
    Electric Gun Brig</i>, your vessel, owing, as you say, "to some
    trifling, though quite unforeseen, hitch in the machinery,"
    should have immediately turned over on its side, upsetting a
    quantity of red-hot coal from the stoke-hole, and projecting a
    stifling rush of steam among the four foreign captains, and the
    two scientific experts whom you had induced to accompany you in
    your projected descent under the bottoms of the three
    first-class ironclads at present moored in the harbour. Your
    alternative ideas of either cutting your vessel in half, and
    turning it into a couple of diving-bells for the purpose of
    seeking for hidden treasure on the Goodwin Sands, or of running
    it under water, for the benefit of those travellers who wish to
    avoid all chances of sea-sickness, between Folkestone and
    Boulogne, seem both worthy of consideration. On the whole,
    however, we should be inclined to think that your last
    suggestion&mdash;namely, that you should put yourself in
    communication with some highly respectable marine-store dealer,
    with a view to the disposal of your "Electric Submarine Gun
    Brig," <i>for the price of old iron</i>, would, perhaps, prove
    the soundest of all. Still, don't be disheartened.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>NOTICE.&mdash;Rejected Communications or Contributions,
    whether MS., Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any
    description, will in no case be returned, not even when
    accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed Envelope, Cover, or
    Wrapper. To this rule there will be no exception.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
